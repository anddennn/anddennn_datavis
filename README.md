Hello! This website was made to quickly demonstrate what I learned in implementing data 
visualizations into HTML, CSS and Javascript. I utilized github to publish the website
into github pages and I coded the whole thing on visual studio code. This is was made as an
assignment for IAT 355. Enjoy looking around! :)

Instructions & Notes:
- The website looks its best on desktop but should be responsive on mobile as well. 
- A custom cursor will appear only on desktop, so it hides your real cursor and acts in its place.
- The main Javascript interactivity is the 'Bouncing Star' SVG. Clicking on it will change the color.
- used an otf font so it might not show up on some browsers..
